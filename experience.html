                Getting to work with underclassmen as they begin to grasp the fundamentals of computational thinking has really helped to solidify the ins and outs of those concepts for myself as well.
                Working one-on-one with students has also improved my ability to clearly communicate my ideas and thought processes even if they take time to be fully understood.
                In addition to working with students in the lab, I have also working with professors to streamline their grading process. This takes the form of writing and tayloring
                scripts to handle and process student input for the professors to grade. These scripts are typically either written in python or bash.

                At DV, I got the chance to work on an internal project that helped staffing and finance teams track
                billing and time allocation for all international ventures.

                One feature set I had the opportunity to work closely with was a series of reporting displays
                for the productâ€™s admin panel.
                Another area of the product that I worked on was collecting and presenting launch analytics
                by integrating Mixpanel metrics into the codebase.
                The tech stack that I got the opportunity to work with was an entirely Node.js environment
                which was great to get experience with. I had never worked with Node.js and it was an
                exciting challenge to not only work with but master a language on the job.

                For my senior year project, I was tasked to work with a team of my peers to develop a system for
                a local lumber company called Hampton Lumber. The goal for the project was to provide a means for
                augmented attention to aid human operators in identifying possible unsafe conditions.<br>
                Much of the time spent in the beginning was used for determining our rules for data annotation
                as well as actually labeling the data. The actually scripts for our model are written in Python
                and harness python libraries like sk-video in order to parse out events in the video stream
                and extract the necessary information.

                It was a pleasure to be able to return to IDS for a second summer and work through a transitional period
                for the same project I had worked on the previous summer.
                In this role, I worked on strengthening the client's understanding of products as well as the
                relationship with DirecTV by acting as long term support.
                I was also able to establish a standardized set of technical documents detailing the initialization
                process and troubleshooting practices for the AT&T DFW Automated Deployment team.

                During my junior year Servant Engineering course, I got the opportunity to work with a non profit called Mission Aviation
                Fellowship on a new project they were working on. The goal of the project was to create a web application that matched
                technical professionals looking to donate their skills to missions projects that were in need of those specific skill
                sets. The tech stack included the a React frontend generated by Gatsby on top of the CMS Strapi. We also spent a good
                deal of time integrating other products into our application to make it more robust and secure. As my first full stack
                project, it was an interesting new challenge to work with this tech stack and ultimately it taught me a lot.

                My first internship experience was something I'll never forget considering it was so early in my career
                and I had so much to learn. I spent much of my time optimizing applications used to test DirecTV products
                by increasing their compatibility with various file formats. I also utilized Agile Scrum practices including
                the use of JIRA in multiple office settings including client companies. This was also my first experince using
                a Linux environment for development and testing.
